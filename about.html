			<h2>Chef</h2>
			<p>Janez Bratovž – a masterchef – is not only among the best chefs in Slovenia but in the whole culinary world. He is the pioneer of the modern Slovenian cuisine with vast experience. His dishes are prepared and served with utmost taste and knowledge.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Janez Bratovž has experienced a lot and even explored molecular gastronomy, but, in the end, discovered that the simplest solutions are also the best. He was one of the first chefs in Slovenia to uncover the importance of quality ingredients, with Ljubljana’s Central Market a part of his morning routine for the last 20 years. For the chef, everything starts with his ingredients. In his own words: “If the ingredients are good, there’s no need for fancy cooking techniques. I like clean, natural tastes. It means the world to me when our guests say that they ate carrots that tasted like they did 40 years ago at my restaurant.”</p>
